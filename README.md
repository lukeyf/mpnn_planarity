# An Investigation of MPNN's Expressiveness on Graph Planarity

This is a mini project of the course Graph Representation investigating the expressiveness of MPNN for planarity testing. 

The main script is at ```mpnn.ipynb```. The viewer should use Google Colab's environment if they wish to execute the script. Note that some of the visualizations do not render by default but can be viewed in ```mpnn.html```
